# Launch the MDM enrollment app in Windows

[Click here to connect to Windows to work](ms-device-enrollment:?mode=mdm)

When you click the link it will launch the enrollment app to connect your device or PC to your email and organizational resources. If the link does not work, you may not have correct version of Windows installed. It is only supported in Windows 10, version 1607.

After the enrollment app is launched, enter your work email address.

Based on IT policy, you may also be prompted to provide a second factor of authentication at this point. When the authentication process completes, you will be connected to your organization's mobile device management service.
