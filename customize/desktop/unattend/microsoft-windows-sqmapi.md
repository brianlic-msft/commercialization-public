# Microsoft-Windows-SQMAPI


The Microsoft-Windows-SQMAPI component implements the Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP). If the component is enabled, it collects and sends data to Microsoft about the use of Windows. Participation in this program is voluntary, and the results are recorded to implement improvements in future releases.

This setting has no effect on Server Core installations.
