# Order


`Order` specifies the order in which to execute the synchronous command.

Synchronous commands start in the order specified in the unattended installation answer file, and each command must finish before the next command starts.

To start a command that needs to finish before other commands can start, use synchronous commands. To run services or commands that can start at the same time, use [RunAsynchronous](microsoft-windows-deployment-runasynchronous.md) instead.

[RunSynchronous](microsoft-windows-deployment-runsynchronous.md) commands run in the user context in the auditUser configuration pass and in the system context in the specialize configuration pass.

## Values

<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />

<td><p><em>Order</em></p></td>
<td><p>Specifies the order in which synchronous commands are to be executed. <em>Order</em> is an integer between 1 and 500.</p></td>
</tr>
