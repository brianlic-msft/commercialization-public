# Assigned access Windows PowerShell reference


Provides Windows PowerShell reference material for the Assigned access feature.

You can use assigned access to set up single-function devices, such as restaurant menus or displays at trade shows. If an account is configured for assigned access, a Windows app of your choosing runs above the lockscreen for the selected user account. Users of that account cannot access any other functionality on the device.

<a href="" id="clear-assignedaccess"></a>[Clear-AssignedAccess](clear-assignedaccess.md)  
Removes the user account from assigned access.

<a href="" id="get-assignedaccess"></a>[Get-AssignedAccess](get-assignedaccess.md)  
Retrieves the current configuration for assigned access.

<a href="" id="set-assignedaccess"></a>[Set-AssignedAccess](set-assignedaccess.md)  
Configures a user to only launch one application
