# Voicemail number for CDMA phones


CDMA mobile operator partners who do not have the voicemail numbers on the device SIM can configure the voicemail number for their devices.

If the voicemail number is not on the SIM and the registry key is not set, the default voicemail will not be set and the user will need to set the number.

<a href="" id="constraints---none"></a>**Constraints:** None  
This customization supports: **per-IMSI** value

<a href="" id="instructions-"></a>**Instructions:**  
1.  Create a customization answer file using the contents shown in the following code sample.

    ``` syntax
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>  
    <ImageCustomizations xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/embedded/2004/10/ImageUpdate"  
                         Name="MOSimFallbackVoicemailNumber"  
                         Description="Use to configure the voicemail number for CDMA phones with no voicemail numbers on the device."  
                         Owner=""  
                         OwnerType="OEM"> 
      
      <!-- Define the Targets --> 
      <Targets>
         <Target Id="">
            <TargetState>
               <Condition Name="" Value="" />
               <Condition Name="" Value="" />
            </TargetState>
         </Target>
      </Targets>
      
      <Static>
        <Settings Path="Multivariant">
          <Setting Name="Enable" Value="1" />
        </Settings>
        <Settings Path="AutoDataConfig">
          <Setting Name="Enable" Value="0" />
        </Settings>
      </Static>

      <!-- Specify the Variant -->
      <Variant Name=""> 
        <TargetRefs>
          <TargetRef Id="" /> 
        </TargetRefs>

        <Settings Path="Phone/PerSimSettings/$(__IMSI)/Critical">  
          <Setting Name="MOSimFallbackVoicemailNumber" Value="" />      
        </Settings>  

      </Variant>

    </ImageCustomizations>
    ```

2.  Specify an `Owner`.

3.  For the **per-IMSI** case:

    1.  Define **Targets** or conditions for when a variant can be applied, such as keying off a SIM's MCC, MNC, and SPN.

    2.  Define settings for a **Variant**, which are applied if the associated target's conditions are met.

4.  Set `MOSimFallbackVoicemailNumber` to the voicemail number that you want to use for the device.

<a href="" id="testing-steps-"></a>**Testing steps:**  
1.  Flash a build containing this customization to a device.

2.  Go to the **Phone** settings screen.

3.  Verify that the voicemail number matches the phone number you specified for `Value`.
