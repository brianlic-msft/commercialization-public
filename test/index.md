# Test for performance and compatibility


We provide an array of tools and technology to help you test performance, compatibility, reliability, and functionality of the hardware and software you create to run with Windows 10. The Windows Hardware Lab Kit (HLK), the Windows Performance Tools (WPT) and the Windows Assessment Toolkit appeal to a wide audience that includes driver developers, hardware manufacturers, system builders, and general application developers.

## About the tools


-   [Windows Hardware Lab Kit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn930814.aspx) – The Windows HLK is a test framework used to test reliability and compatibility of hardware devices used with Windows 10.
-   [Windows Performance Toolkit](wpt/index.md) – WPT helps you measure, analyze and troubleshoot performance to create fast, fluid, and efficient systems.
-   [Windows Assessment Toolkit](assessments/index.md) – The assessment toolkit provides additional tools and tests that help you determine the quality of a running operating system or a set of components with regard to performance, reliability, and functionality.
