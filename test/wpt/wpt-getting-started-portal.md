WPT Getting Started is designed for developers who want to learn how to use performance monitoring tools featured in the Windows Performance Toolkit (WPT). These tools produce in-depth performance profiles of Windows operating systems and applications, which developers can use to diagnose and fix system and application issues. This Getting Started documentation discusses basic processes for both Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) and Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA).
