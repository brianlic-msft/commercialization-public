# Graph Explorer


The Graph Explorer window displays thumbnails of all graphs that you can use to view the data of the current recording. The thumbnails are grouped by type under the following categories:

-   System Activity

-   Computation

-   Storage

-   Memory

-   System Power Source

-   Other

You can expand each node to show all graphs in that category by clicking on the triangle next to the category.

To view a graph at full resolution with the associated summary tables, drag the graph from the Graph Explorer window onto the **Analysis** tab.

The Graph Explorer window appears on the left side of the user interface when you first open Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA). However, you can undock it or dock it elsewhere in the primary window.
