# Analysis Assistant


The **Analysis Assistant** tab is the central workspace of Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA). To analyze a recording, you can drag graph thumbnails from the Graph Explorer window onto this tab. At the left side of each graph is a legend that labels the lines or bars on the graph and an associated data table. The data table shows the graph data in tabular form.
