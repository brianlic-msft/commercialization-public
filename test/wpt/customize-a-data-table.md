# Customize a Data Table


You can customize the data tables that are associated with each graph in several ways.

**To sort by a column**

1.  Click the header bar of the desired column.

2.  Click the header bar again to reverse the sorting.

**To change the column selection**

1.  Right-click the header bar, and select or clear the checkbox next to columns that you do not want to see.

2.  When you are finished, click **Done**.

**To make a column into a key**

1.  If you do not see the vertical gold bar, scroll to the right.

2.  Drag the column that you want to make into a key to the left of the vertical gold bar.

**To make a column into a graphing element**

-   Drag the column that you want to make into a graphing element to the right of the vertical blue bar.

    For a list of columns that can be made into graphing elements, see [Data Tables](data-tables.md).

**To freeze columns**

1.  Right-click the table, and click **Show/Hide Freeze Bars**.

2.  Drag the columns that you want to freeze between the vertical gray bars.

    The horizontal scroll bar then scrolls only between those columns.
