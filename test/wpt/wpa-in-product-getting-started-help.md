When you open Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA), by default, the Getting Started tab is displayed. Getting Started is in-product help that provides an overview (with corresponding topics) to help you successfully ramp up into analyzing traces with WPA.

It features the following topics:

**Note**  
These topics feature basic information for getting started. For more in-depth information, refer to the Related Topics at the end of this topic.
