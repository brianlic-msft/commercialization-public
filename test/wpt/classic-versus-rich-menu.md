# Classic versus Rich Menu


## Classic Menu and Rich Menu


By default, WPA uses the Classic menu when you open a recording. Like most applications, the Classic Menu displays menus (File, Trace, etc.) at the top. If you prefer a more compact, intuitive, and modern UI, you can use the Rich Menu. The Rich Menu:

-   Pulls together the old menus from the Classic Menu
-   Features shortcuts to menus you frequently use, such as Open, Apply Profile, Load Symbols, etc.
-   Uses only one menu (File) as the entry point to all of the menu options

For more information on the differences between the Classic Menu and Rich Text menu and how to switch back-and-forth between them, see Classic versus Rich Menu.
