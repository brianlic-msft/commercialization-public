# Windows Performance Step-by-Step Guides


The following guides provide step-by-step exercises to help you understand, record, and analyze traces for the following scenarios:

-   [Optimizing the memory footprint](memory-footprint-optimization.md)
-   [Optimizing performance and responsiveness](optimizing-performance-and-responsiveness.md)
-   [Debugging power problems with standby](debugging-problems-with-standby.md)
-   [Optimizing Windows devices for multimedia experiences](optimizing-windows-devices-for-multimedia-experiences.md)

**Note**  The exercises in each step-by-step guide build on the previous exercise(s) in their respective guide. For example, in the Memory Footprint Optimization step-by-step guide, featured exercises include identifying processes with large working sets, tracking user mode process allocations, and tracking driver footprint and dynamic allocations during boot.
