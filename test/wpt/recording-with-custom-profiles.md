# Recording with Custom Profiles


In addition to the built-in profiles, Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) can record from custom profiles that are authored in XML. For more information about how to author custom profiles, see [Authoring Recording Profiles](authoring-recording-profiles.md) and the [Recording Profile XML Reference](recording-profile-xml-reference.md).

Custom profiles can be run together with one or more built-in profiles. The **General** profile is always runs together with a custom profile.

The following procedure shows how to select a custom profile in the WPR user interface (UI). For command-line options, see [WPR Command-Line Options](wpr-command-line-options.md).

**To record by using custom profiles**

1.  In the WPR UI, click **More options**.

2.  Click **Add Profiles**, and then navigate to the location of the profile or profiles.

3.  Select the desired profile or profiles, and then click **Open**.
