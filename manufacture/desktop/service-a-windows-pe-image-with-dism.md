# Service a Windows PE Image with DISM


You can service a Windows® Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) image and add or remove packages, drivers, and language packs just as you would any Windows image using the appropriate driver, package, or international-servicing commands in Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM.exe). There are also commands that are specific to a Windows PE image, which you can use to prepare the Windows PE environment, enable profiling, list packages and prepare the Windows PE image for deployment.

For more information about how to customize a Windows PE image, see [WinPE: Mount and Customize](winpe-mount-and-customize.md). For more information about DISM commands that are specific to a Windows PE image, see [DISM Windows PE Servicing Command-Line Options](dism-windows-pe-servicing-command-line-options.md).
