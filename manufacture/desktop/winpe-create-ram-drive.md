# WinPE: Create WinPE RAM drive

Create a [Windows PE (WinPE) bootable USB flash drive or an external USB hard drive](winpe-create-usb-bootable-drive.md).

The default installation runs from memory (RAM disk), so you can remove the drive while Windows PE is running.

Compare this to Flat Boot, which boots faster, but the drive can't be removed once it's started. See [WinPE: Install on a Hard Drive (Flat Boot or Non-RAM)](winpe-install-on-a-hard-drive--flat-boot-or-non-ram.md)
