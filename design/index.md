# Design Windows 10 devices


Building a great Windows 10 device starts with selecting the right components. Understanding the difference between minimum and optimal hardware requirements will ensure the best usability and performance. To take advantage of the latest features like Cortana and Continuum, your hardware must meet specific requirements to ensure an optimal device experience.

## Form factors

Windows 10 supports a wide range of devices—from phones, to tablets and laptops, to All-in-one or desktop devices. See [Form factors](form-factors/form-factors.md) to choose your device and learn more info about creating great Windows devices.

## Design guidelines

The minimum hardware requirements specification defines the minimum hardware requirements necessary to boot and run Windows 10, update and service Windows 10, and provide a baseline user experience that is comparable with similar devices and computers.

Minimum hardware requirements enable OEMs, ODMs, SoC vendors, and other component vendors to make early design decisions for devices and computers that will run Windows 10.
