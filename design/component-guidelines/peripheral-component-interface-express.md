# Peripheral Component Interface Express


This topic provides recommendations for PCI Express (PCIe) in Windows 10. PCIe is a supported interface for form factors with devices requiring higher interconnect bandwidth. PCIe is most likely to be less energy efficient for battery-powered form factors compared to other mobile interconnect solutions. Chipset vendors and OEMs are advised to consider the overall power budget for the target device before selecting PCIe to connect a given peripheral chip.

Computers that run Windows Server 2016 must support PCI Express natively, and they must include a storage adapter and a network adapter that is compliant with the PCI Express architecture specification.
