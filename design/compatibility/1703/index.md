# Hardware Compatibility Specifications for Windows 10, version 1703

The Windows Hardware Compatibility Program is designed to help your company deliver systems, software and hardware products that are compatible with Windows and run reliably on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016.

The Windows Hardware Compatibility Program leverages the tests in the Windows Hardware Lab Kit to test your product. After passing certain tests, the program allows you to use the Windows logo as part of your marketing. End users trust the Windows logo as a sign of compatibility. Enterprise and government customers also look for the logo, or consult the Microsoft Certified Products list or the server catalog to see what systems, components and peripherals have been tested to ensure interoperability and reliability.

The requirements are validated by HLK tests and categorized as follows:

- [System requirements](systems.md)
- [Device and peripheral requirements](device.md) for a stand-alone device
- [Filter driver requirements](filter.md) - Windows Filtering Platform drivers (WPF), file system filter drivers, antivirus, and Early Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM) filter drivers.

When products meet the minimum requirements it ensures that the application and device are compatible. Systems are required to use components which have also passed compatibility testing. Products submitted with passing results will continue to be included on the Certified Products List.

> [!WARNING]
> Certification for Windows Server 2016, Azure Stack, and SDDC must continue to meet the Windows Hardware Compatibility Requirements as stated in version 1607 of documentation, must use [version 1607 of the HLK (build 14393)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=404112) with [matching playlist](http://aka.ms/hlkplaylist) and supplemental content to generate logs, and must follow policies as stated in the [Windows Server Policy document](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834831). Questions about the Azure Stack or SDDC programs or how to submit the results for solution validation should be directed to the appropriate Microsoft technical account manager or partner management contact.

## Official Test Playlist

The Windows Hardware Compatibility Program uses an official playlist to determine which devices meet the requirements for compatibility with Windows 10. All playlists that we have published are acceptable to use for submissions to the Hardware Developer Portal (sysdev).

The latest playlist can be downloaded at the following location:
