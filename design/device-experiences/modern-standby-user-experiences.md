# Modern standby user experiences


Modern standby is more than just a low-power sleep state—it is part of many Windows 10 fundamental user experiences. When the screen is off, the modern standby state is presented to the user as the system "sleep" state.

The following topics describe the modern standby user experience.

<td><p>The fundamental user experience of modern standby is simply putting the PC to sleep.</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><p>[Turning on (wake)](turning-on--wake-.md)</p></td>
<td><p>The largest benefit to the modern standby user experience is the instant resume when the system is turned on. Because Wi-Fi is always on during modern standby, turning on the system allows the user to immediately get to work—with fast turn-on, Wi-Fi already connected, and email already synced.</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>[Simple app and tile updates](simple-app-and-tile-updates.md)</p></td>
<td><p>Modern standby enables the system to stay fresh and up-to-date by maintaining constant connectivity and by carefully controlling the execution of app background tasks.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>[Audio notifications](audio-notifications.md)</p></td>
<td><p>If a lock screen app generates a notification and resulting toast during modern standby, a short audio alert is played. The display stays turned off while the alert plays.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>[Quiet Hours](quiet-hours.md)</p></td>
<td><p>Notifications during modern standby and their auditory alerts can be disturbing to some users, particularly in the evening and late night hours. The Quiet Hours feature suppresses notifications and helps save battery power. Quiet Hours allows the user to define a period of time each day during which notifications and background tasks are suppressed.</p></td>
